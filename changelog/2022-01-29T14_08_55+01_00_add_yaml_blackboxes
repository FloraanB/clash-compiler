ADDED:
  Added support for YAML blackboxes. Clash will now pickup on files with a
  `.primitives.yaml` extension. While we recommend upgrading your primitive files
  to the new format, old style primitives are still supported.

  Depending on whether you use Stack or Cabal you can execute the following to
  upgrade your primitive files:

  ```
  cabal run clash-lib:v16-upgrade-primitives -- --help
  ```

  Stack users can use:

  ```
  stack exec --package clash-lib v16-upgrade-primitives -- --help
  ```

  Both commands assume you're running them in an up-to-date
  [(starter) project environment](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-starters).

ADDED:
  Added `InlineYamlPrimitive` constructor to `Clash.Annotations.Primitive.InlinePrimitive` to
  support YAML blackboxes. No automated upgrade tool exists to upgrade `InlinePrimitive`
  annotations.
