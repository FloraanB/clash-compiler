DEPRECATED: `unsafeFromLowPolarity`, `unsafeFromHighPolarity`, `unsafeToLowPolarity`, `unsafeToHighPolarity` have been replaced by `unsafeFromActiveLow`, `unsafeFromActiveHigh`, `unsafeToActiveLow`, `unsafeToActiveHigh`. While former ones will continue to exist, a deprecation warning has been added pointing to the latter ones.
