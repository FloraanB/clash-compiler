ADDED: `Clash.DataFiles.tclConnector` and the executable `static-files` in
`clash-lib`. They can be used to get a Tcl script that allows Vivado to interact
with the metadata generated by Clash. The Tcl proc `clash::readHdl` will issue
`read_vhdl`/`read_verilog` calls that add all the generated HDL files, and
`clash::readXdc` will issue `read_xdc` commands for constraints on the top
entity.

You can write a copy of the Tcl script to a file by invoking
    cabal run clash-lib:static-files -- --tcl-connector clashConnector.tcl
