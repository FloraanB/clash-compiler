Internal change: Added `showsTypePrec` to `TermLiteral` to make `TermLiteral SNat` work as expected. Deriving an instance is now a bit simpler. Instances which previously had to be defined as:

```haskell
instance TermLiteral Bool where
  termToData = $(deriveTermToData ''Bool)
```

can now be defined using:

```haskell
deriveTermLiteral ''Bool
```

Internal add: Added `TermLiteral` instance for `Either`.
