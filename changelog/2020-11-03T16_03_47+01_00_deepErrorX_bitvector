CHANGED: 'deepErrorX' is now equal to 'undefined#', which means that instead of
the whole BitVector being undefined, its individual bits are. This makes
sure bit operations are possible on it.

Motivation: allows a shift register to be gradually filled with bits
until there are no undefined bits, whereas previously this would
terminate the simulation.
